	Don't look at this .. it's horrible and hacky.  
	It's only a one off, no point wasting time making it nice :-)

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
	Small helper to migrate your <a href='https://www.google.com/bookmarks/'>Google Bookmarks</a> to <a href='https://tagpacker.com/'>TagPacker</a>.
</p>

<h2 class='warning'>Warning / Disclaimer / Get out of jail free card</h2>
<p class='warning'>
	WARNING: This is just something I knocked up to solve a problem I was facing.  Use at your own risk.  If you lose any data, your're on your own I'm afraid.
	Keep a copy of your exported bookmarks, in addition to this file.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, this should be pretty straight-forward :-)
</p>

<h2>Analyse</h2>
<p>
	You've already copied and pasted this bit of code into your export file from <a href='https://www.google.com/bookmarks/'>Google Bookmarks</a>, yeah?
</p>

<div class="indent">
	<button id="analyse">Analyse</button>
</div>
<p>
	When prompted, save the CSV file somewhere convenient.
</p>

<h2>Review</h2>
<p>
	Okay, we've now got a CSV file with thousands of rows.
	Load the CSV file into Excel or Google Sheets or whatever 
	(it's a tab delimited file, you may be best opening a fresh worksheet
	and pasting the file contents in).
</p>
<p>
	In the spreadsheet you'll see a <strong>Delete</strong> column.
	Enter <i>anything</i> in this column and that link <strong>won't</strong>
	be imported later.  You can just delete the row if you'd prefer.
</p>
<p>
	You can also order by the <strong>Date</strong> field and maybe just
	delete any thing over 5 years old?  Your choice.
</p>

<h2>Upload Reviewed Spreadsheet</h2>
<p>
	Once you've completed your review, copy the content to the clipboard 
	and paste into the <strong>Reviewed Bookmarks</strong> textbox below:
</p>
<label for="uploadData">Reviewed Bookmarks</label>
<textarea id="uploadData" cols="200" rows="20">

</textarea>
<p>
	And click the button below.
</p>
<button id="upload">Upload Reviewed</button>

<p>
	The script will then generate multiple bookmark files so you can safetly
	upload in batches rather than one large file.
</p>

<script src="export-to-csv.js">
